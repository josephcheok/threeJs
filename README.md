Experimentation with new Js library
I wanted to create a Rubiks cube to incorporate into my portfolio website to show that I was a problem solver.
I did it with the help of this amazing library.

## Steps to Creation

I got the basic cube model from three.js and did the following:

1. Added texture by loading a texture map of a rubiks cube
2. Added animation effect on cube to view all 6 sides
3. Colored the different sides of the cube
4. Added lighting
5. Played with shininess and specular settings to create surface sheen
